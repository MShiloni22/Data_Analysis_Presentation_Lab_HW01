It had to be brought together, he added, saying action was needed on poverty, the Middle East and the conditions on which terrorists prey. Mr Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism.\\n \\n But there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by \\\"military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values\\\" he added. Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the world's single most \\\"pressing political challenge\\\" of the present day, Mr Blair warned. The prime minister also urged Europe and the US to \\\"build anew their alliance\\\".\\n \\n \\\"All of us in positions of leadership, not just President Bush, have a responsibility to rise to this challenge. It is urgent that we do so.\\\" Mr Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerry's campaign, saying he had helped make the presidential election \\\"a true celebration of American democracy\\\". The election of the US president was significant for the world but particularly so for Britain because of its special relationship, he added. Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Mr Bush his \\\"warmest congratulations\\\", saying: \\\"We look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom.\\\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election, unlike in 2000.\\n \\n Mr Bush's first task was to \\\"rebuild a sense of domestic purpose\\\" within the US, he said. Mr Kennedy said: \\\"Internationally, it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies, not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism.\\\" Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an \\\"umbilical cord\\\" between Mr Bush and the UK premier.\\n \\n \\\"Europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character, and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the Atlantic partnership which is so vital to security. \\\"Iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come.\\\" Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.\\n \\n Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker underlined the issue of global warming during a Commons debate on Anglo-American relations on Wednesday. Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett has said the US will act on global warming despite George Bush's refusal to sign up to the Kyoto protocol on carbon emissions. Public opinion would force change, she told BBC news. But Myron Ebell, an adviser on climate change to President Bush, has said there would be no change in the US stance and rejected the threat of climate change. He claimed the US was the only country with independent scientists.\\n\",\n          \"China Aviation seeks rescue deal\\n \\n Scandal-hit jet fuel supplier China Aviation Oil has offered to repay its creditors $220m (\\u00c2\\u00a3117m) of the $550m it lost on trading in oil futures.\\n \\n The firm said it hoped to pay $100m now and another $120m over eight years. With assets of $200m and liabilities totalling $648m, it needs creditors' backing for the offer to avoid going into bankruptcy. The trading scandal is the biggest to hit Singapore since the $1.2bn collapse of Barings Bank in 1995. Chen Jiulin, chief executive of China Aviation Oil (CAO), was arrested by at Changi Airport by Singapore police on 8 December. He was returning from China, where he had headed when CAO announced its trading debacle in late-November. The firm had been betting heavily on a fall in the price of oil during October, but prices rose sharply instead.\\n \\n Among the creditors whose backing CAO needs for its restructuring plan are banking giants such as Barclay's Capital and Sumitomo Mitsui, as well as South Korean firm SK Energy. Of the immediate payment, the firm - China's biggest jet fuel supplier - said it would be paying $30m out of its own resources. The rest would come from its parent company, China Aviation Oil Holding Company in Beijing. The holding company, owned by the Chinese government, holds most of CAO's Singapore-listed shares. It cut its holding from 75% to 60% on 20 October.\\n\",\n          \"Yukos heading back to US courts\\n \\n Russian oil and gas company Yukos is due in a US court on Thursday as it continues to fight for its survival.\\n \\n The firm is in the process of being broken up by Russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (\\u00c2\\u00a314bn) tax bill. Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the US, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, Yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm Rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted.\\n \\n Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated US bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means. The company wants damages of $20bn, claiming Yuganskneftegas was sold at less than market value. Judge Letitia Clark will hear different motions, including one from Deutsche Bank to throw out the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The German lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned company that was expected to win the auction for Yuganskneftegas. Deutsche Bank, which is also an advisor to Gazprom, has called on the US court to overturn its decision to provide Yukos with bankruptcy protection.\\n \\n Lifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify Deutsche Bank's business position, analysts said.\\n \\n Analysts are not optimistic about Yukos' chances in court. Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country's legal authorities have repeatedly said that the US has no jurisdiction over Yukos and its legal wranglings. On top of that, the firm only has limited assets in the US. Yukos has won small victories, however, and is bullish about its chances in court. \\\"Do we have an ability to influence what happens? We think we do,\\\" said Mike Lake, a Yukos spokesman. \\\"The litigation risks are real,\\\" said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Vadim Mitroshin The dispute with the Russian authorities is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          4,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It had to be brought together, he added, saying action was needed on poverty, the Middle East and the conditions on which terrorists prey. Mr Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism.\\n \\n But there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by \\\"military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values\\\" he added. Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the world's single most \\\"pressing political challenge\\\" of the present day, Mr Blair warned. The prime minister also urged Europe and the US to \\\"build anew their alliance\\\".\\n \\n \\\"All of us in positions of leadership, not just President Bush, have a responsibility to rise to this challenge. It is urgent that we do so.\\\" Mr Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerry's campaign, saying he had helped make the presidential election \\\"a true celebration of American democracy\\\". The election of the US president was significant for the world but particularly so for Britain because of its special relationship, he added. Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Mr Bush his \\\"warmest congratulations\\\", saying: \\\"We look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom.\\\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election, unlike in 2000.\\n \\n Mr Bush's first task was to \\\"rebuild a sense of domestic purpose\\\" within the US, he said. Mr Kennedy said: \\\"Internationally, it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies, not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism.\\\" Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an \\\"umbilical cord\\\" between Mr Bush and the UK premier.\\n \\n \\\"Europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character, and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the Atlantic partnership which is so vital to security. \\\"Iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come.\\\" Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.\\n \\n Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker underlined the issue of global warming during a Commons debate on Anglo-American relations on Wednesday. Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett has said the US will act on global warming despite George Bush's refusal to sign up to the Kyoto protocol on carbon emissions. Public opinion would force change, she told BBC news. But Myron Ebell, an adviser on climate change to President Bush, has said there would be no change in the US stance and rejected the threat of climate change. He claimed the US was the only country with independent scientists.\\n\",\n          \"China Aviation seeks rescue deal\\n \\n Scandal-hit jet fuel supplier China Aviation Oil has offered to repay its creditors $220m (\\u00c2\\u00a3117m) of the $550m it lost on trading in oil futures.\\n \\n The firm said it hoped to pay $100m now and another $120m over eight years. With assets of $200m and liabilities totalling $648m, it needs creditors' backing for the offer to avoid going into bankruptcy. The trading scandal is the biggest to hit Singapore since the $1.2bn collapse of Barings Bank in 1995. Chen Jiulin, chief executive of China Aviation Oil (CAO), was arrested by at Changi Airport by Singapore police on 8 December. He was returning from China, where he had headed when CAO announced its trading debacle in late-November. The firm had been betting heavily on a fall in the price of oil during October, but prices rose sharply instead.\\n \\n Among the creditors whose backing CAO needs for its restructuring plan are banking giants such as Barclay's Capital and Sumitomo Mitsui, as well as South Korean firm SK Energy. Of the immediate payment, the firm - China's biggest jet fuel supplier - said it would be paying $30m out of its own resources. The rest would come from its parent company, China Aviation Oil Holding Company in Beijing. The holding company, owned by the Chinese government, holds most of CAO's Singapore-listed shares. It cut its holding from 75% to 60% on 20 October.\\n\",\n          \"Yukos heading back to US courts\\n \\n Russian oil and gas company Yukos is due in a US court on Thursday as it continues to fight for its survival.\\n \\n The firm is in the process of being broken up by Russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (\\u00c2\\u00a314bn) tax bill. Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the US, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, Yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm Rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted.\\n \\n Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated US bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means. The company wants damages of $20bn, claiming Yuganskneftegas was sold at less than market value. Judge Letitia Clark will hear different motions, including one from Deutsche Bank to throw out the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The German lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned company that was expected to win the auction for Yuganskneftegas. Deutsche Bank, which is also an advisor to Gazprom, has called on the US court to overturn its decision to provide Yukos with bankruptcy protection.\\n \\n Lifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify Deutsche Bank's business position, analysts said.\\n \\n Analysts are not optimistic about Yukos' chances in court. Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country's legal authorities have repeatedly said that the US has no jurisdiction over Yukos and its legal wranglings. On top of that, the firm only has limited assets in the US. Yukos has won small victories, however, and is bullish about its chances in court. \\\"Do we have an ability to influence what happens? We think we do,\\\" said Mike Lake, a Yukos spokesman. \\\"The litigation risks are real,\\\" said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Vadim Mitroshin The dispute with the Russian authorities is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          4,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "Answer: The maximum potential punishment for Luis Aragones' racist comments about Thierry Henry would depend on the specific legal context and any regulatory guidelines in place at the time of the incident. However, I can provide some general information on potential consequences for racist remarks in a sports context.\n",
            "\n",
            "In most countries, racist comments made in public, especially by high-profile individuals, can be considered a form of hate speech or incitement to racial hatred. Such actions are often prohibited by law and can carry legal consequences, including but not limited to:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Criminal charges: Depending on the jurisdiction, Aragones could potentially face criminal charges for his comments. This could result in fines, community service, or even a prison sentence if convicted.\n",

            "2. Civil lawsuits: Thierry Henry or other affected parties could potentially file civil lawsuits against Aragones, seeking damages for emotional distress, harm to reputation, or other losses resulting from the racist comments.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Disciplinary action by sports governing bodies: The football association or other governing body could impose sanctions on Aragones, such as fines, suspension, or even a ban from the sport. These disciplinary measures aim to uphold the values of fair play and respect within the sport and serve as a deterrent for future incidents.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Loss of endorsements and sponsorships: Aragones' racist comments could lead to a loss of endorsements and sponsorships, as companies may distance themselves from individuals who engage in such behavior to protect their brand image and reputation.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Public backlash and reputational damage: Aragones would likely face significant public backlash and criticism for his comments, which could damage his reputation and affect his future career prospects.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is worth noting that the specific consequences would depend on various factors, including the severity of the comments, the jurisdiction in which they were made, and the specific regulations in place within the football governing body. It is always advisable to seek legal advice for a more precise understanding of the potential punishments in a specific case.\n",

This prompted Rafael Benitez, the Liverpool manager at the time, to issue a warning to Gerrard, reminding him that no player is bigger than the club and that he needed to focus on his responsibilities as a player.

            " The 66-year-old criticised his 3000 euros (Â£2,060) punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty. \"I am not guilty, nor do I accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport,\" he said. \"I'm not a racist and I've never lacked sporting decorum. I've never done that and I have medals for sporting merit.\" Aragones was handed the fine on Tuesday after making racist remarks about Henry to Arsenal team-mate and Spanish international Jose Reyes last October.\n",
            " \n",
            " The Spanish Football Federation at first declined to take action against Aragones, but was then requested to do so by Spain's anti-violence commission. The fine was far less than the expected amount of about Â£22,000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who was fined Â£15,000 in December for accusing Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy of cheating, believes that Aragones' punishment was too lenient. \"You compare his fine and my fine, and if you consider his was for racist abuse, then you seem to get away with it more in Spain than you should,\" Wenger said. \"He shouldn't have said what he said, and how much money is enough, I don't know but it doesn't look a big punishment.\" However, Aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair. \"I have been treated like Islero (the bull that killed famous bullfighter Manolete),\" said Aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions. \"I have not liked one thing about this whole affair and I do not agree with the sanction. They have looked for a scapegoat.\" Spain's anti-violence commission must now ratify the Spanish FA's decision and has until next week to announce its verdict. Aragones has 10 days to appeal, and the commission can also appeal. Alberto Flores, president of the Spanish FA's disciplinary committee, said no-one in the committee felt Aragones was a racist nor had \"acted in a racist way.\" \"A fine, the highest we could apply, is sufficient punishment. Suspension would have been a bit exaggerated,\" Flores told sports daily Marca.\n",

William Gallas and Damien Duff could also miss the Barcelona game.

            " With Bridge having gone off after Mourinho used all three substitutes, those knocks plus Carlo Cudicini's red card meant Chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players. Cudicini would not have played against Barcelona, but had been promised a game in the Carling Cup final, although he will now miss the Cardiff showpiece through suspension.

            " Celestine Babayaro left the club in January, ironically to join Newcastle, and although Gallas has deputised at left-back before, he is struggling to be fit himself. It could be that Paulo Ferreira, usually a right-back, is switched to left-back with Glen Johnson, who ended the Newcastle game in goal, playing on the right. Youngsters Ben Hudell, Joe Keenan and Sam Tillen would be options should Mourinho decide to call up a replacement, but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a Champions League tie. Bridge's injury also means Mourinho, who reportedly wants to sign Ashley Cole from Arsenal, will not have a specialist, senior left-back for the run-in to the season.\n",

We will have to wait and see, but I won't cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on Tuesday.\" Shearer said he was unsure what caused Bridge's injury. \"I don't know what happened.\" he said. \"It was just a shame. I don't think we even touched each other. \"By all accounts it's pretty serious.

And he added: \"It felt different then last summer when I had the same injury on my other foot. \"Then I could walk already after three days but I stayed sidelined for a long period. I hope that it will now take me six to eight weeks.\" Chelsea physio Mike Banks was hopeful that Robben could return at some point in March. \"The fractures are tiny and he could be playing next month,\" Banks told the club's website. \"One is a chip on the side of his foot, the other is a small break on the third metatarsal. \"But this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last World Cup and which has kept Scott Parker out for two months.\"\n",

            " The Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: \"It was a really great night. \"The players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans. \"We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances. For Liverpool, this result is very, very important.\" Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. The Reds scored three second-half goals in a sensational comeback capped by Gerrard's 20-yard drive. He added: \"Steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"I have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us. \"I felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters, I cannot thank them enough. \"I want to say thank-you to the supporters, they were magnificent to help us achieve this result.\" Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time. He said: \"I'd be lying if I thought we were going through when we were losing at half-time.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"We had a mountain to climb, but we have climbed it and credit to everyone. \"That was one of the best goals I have scored, I caught it sweet, I haven't caught one like that for ages. It was a massive night for me and the team.\" Liverpool's win means all four of England's Champions League representatives have reached the knockout stages for the first time.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Gerrard happy at Anfield\n",
            " \n",
            " Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has reiterated his desire to stay at Anfield and win trophies with the club.\n",
            " \n",
            " The 24-year-old England midfielder is determined to see out his contract, despite reported interest from Chelsea. He said: \"I'm signed here for this season and another two so there is no situation. There's a lot of speculation but that's not down to me. \"As club captain all I want to do is help us get back up the table and into the Champions League again.\" Gerrard looked set to move to Chelsea during the summer and speculation of a switch to Stamford Bridge has again arisen, with the January transfer window approaching. He raised doubts about his Reds future when he said he wanted the club to prove they were title challengers in the very near future or he might leave. Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has insisted that Gerrard has promised him he wants to stay at Anfield. Benitez said: \"I said to Steven that I was sure he wanted to stay here and he said 'I do'.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"I then said to him 'Look, if you want to win titles, you want medals and you want Liverpool to have these things then I am going to need your help'. \"I really think he wants to stay so now what we must do is make the squad stronger for him.\" Meanwhile, Gerrard has urged the Anfield board to sign Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes in the January transfer window. Morientes, 28, has already expressed a willingness to come to England. Gerrard added: \"He's a great player. He scores goals in the league, in cup competitions and also in the Champions League. \"I don't think he'd be able to play for us in Europe this season but if we are able to get hold of him, we'd be getting ourselves a great player.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"He'd have Spanish coaches, a Spanish manager and we have got three or four Spanish players here now so they'll help him settle in. \"Rafael Benitez knows what he wants and he knows how to strengthen the squad he's got and if the right players become available at the right price I am sure we will strengthen. \"It would certainly be nice to see a few new faces in January to freshen things up.\"\n",
